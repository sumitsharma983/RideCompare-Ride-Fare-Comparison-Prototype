# RideCompare-Ride-Fare-Comparison-Prototype
RideCompare is a prototype web app showcasing the concept of comparing ride fares from services like Uber, Ola, and Rapido. Using placeholder data, it demonstrates the planned features and user flow. The project lays the groundwork for a future platform with real-time API integration and fare comparison tools.
